## The Movie Client
This project was an attempt at a movie client using a backend and combining it with a front end.
I created a <a href="https://github.com/Rohnson95/FilmAPI">REST</a> api in a previous project which was used to create and retrieve information and render it through a React js app.
I also used TMDB(The Movie Database) external api to retrieve things such as posters and movie descriptions.

HOW TO USE: 
1. There is a "home" page that displays each existing user from a database
2. You can CLICK on each user, getting 3 different tables, one to add new genres you like, one that shows movies you like and their rating, and one that shows all existing ratings you enjoy.
3. The "movies" tab in the navbar shows you pages of movies ascending in popularity. Each banner is clickable with the option of adding the movie and rating it to your own liking. There is currently no submit button here so the movie and rating gets added as soon as there's a change. This is something that needs fixing in the future.
4. There's a "prev page", "next page" and search bar at the top so you can search for your favorite film to add!

You Can find some images of how this looks below!

### Reflection
I feel like there's a lot to still uncover with react, I felt like I touched the more complicated topics and systems but barely.
There are also lots of changes I want to commit to fixing as this project is closing its doors, one example is the fact that I still don't have a submit button available for when you want to add a movie you liked with a rating on it.
It was a very fun and eye opening experience in the world of "fullstack" programming, as I created the API endpoints on the backend myself and combined an external api.
I feel like there's a lot to brush up on the design aspect of the webpage, but I'm happy with it's state considering it's the first "version" of it
P.S - Design is not my strong suite, so sorry to anyone whos eyes bleed after they view the preview images.
